  <p class="title"><b>Current Interest</b></p>
  <p>At the moment I enjoy using dynamic languages such as python but I do use lower level languages like C++ and C if the situation call for it. </p>
  <p class="title"><b>BIO</b></p>
  <p >My interest in computers started out at a young age, I started out with a desktop computer running windows 95 in the bright year of 2005 and eventually moved up to a laptop computer with windows 7 my Father gifted me.
    My first dive into programming started with a TI-84 running <a href="http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/"> TI-BASIC</a> back in high school, I ended up diving headfirst into SDL with a small raycaster I wrote which is lost to history now.
      Currently I'm focusing my efforts into designing pleasant web viewing experience and furthering my knowledge of opengl and graphics programming in general.

  </p>
    <p>Curerent hobbies and interest of mine include hiking,camping,cycling,and some fish keeping on the side</p>
